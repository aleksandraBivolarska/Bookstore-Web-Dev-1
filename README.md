Project Proposal: 
    For my Web Development 1 project I thought it would be interesting for me to create an online bookstore, where users can login as either buyers or sellers (employees).  The main functionalities will include:
    
    Customers:
        •	Users can login/logout to the platform as customers
        •	Users can view books offered
        •	Users can filter books by specific criteria (author, genre, etc.)
        •	Users can order books
        •	Users can view a list of their purchases so far
    Employees:
        •	Employees can login to the platform
        •	Employees can CRUD available books on the platform
        •	Employees can overview customer orders
